MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network

Overview

This project implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it achieves high accuracy in recognizing digits from images.

Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of:

60,000 training images

10,000 test images

Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

OpenCV & PIL (for image processing)
